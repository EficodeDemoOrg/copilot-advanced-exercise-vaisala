# Project

This exercise uses a multi-agent development workflow with specialized AI agents for different phases of development.

### Documentation

- **[Agents and Prompts](Agents%20and%20Prompts.md)** - Comprehensive system reference detailing the agent architecture, roles, capabilities, and protocols. Read this if you want to understand how the multi-agent system works.

- **[Exercise Guide](exercise-guide.md)** - Step-by-step walkthrough for building the Context Window Visualizer. Start here if you're ready to begin the exercise immediately.

### Quick Start

If you're impatient and want to dive in:
1. Read the **Exercise Guide** and follow the steps
2. Reference the **Agents and Prompts** documentation when you need clarification

If you prefer to understand the system first:
1. Read the **Agents and Prompts** documentation to learn about the workflow
2. Then follow the **Exercise Guide** to build the project

## Learning Goals

- **Adopt an Agentic Workflow:** The primary goal is to practice building a complete prototype using an AI agent as your primary development partner.
- **Practice Blueprint Creation:** Start new projects by collaborating with an AI Architect to establish foundational technical decisions before implementation.
- **Practice Thread Isolation:** Learn to manage complexity by assigning distinct, single-purpose tasks to separate, isolated agent threads.
- **Utilize AI for Planning:** Use the agent not just for coding, but as a strategic partner to create a project roadmap and a TODO.md to track progress.
- **Task Decomposition:** Break down the larger project goal into small, well-defined tasks that can be completed by a focused agent in a single thread.
- **Practice Memory Persistence Between Agent Threads:** Utilize markdown files (BLUEPRINT.md, research.md, developer_todo.md) in a systematic way to ground agents in a shared 'memory'.
- **Leverage Agent Roles:** Improve the quality of the AI's output by assigning it specific, expert roles for different phases of the project.
